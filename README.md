# lolapiproject

This is my personal LoL API project.

Context:
The purpose of this project is to address a theory inspired in the reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends forums that Riot's matchmaking system is flawed by displaying the only form of communication the community can comprehend, charts and graphs! The goal is to either display that Riot Games is targetting you as the player and intentionally screwing you over by placing incompetent teammates on your team, or maybe they did their jobs correctly. 

Expectations:
Results should theoretically display close towards a normal bell curve for most elos with the exception of Master/Challenger and Bronze V peoples. 

Features:
-Display only allies/enemies
-Display only Victory/Defeat matches 
-Cherrypick matches to optimally normalize or skew data 
-Link to matchhistory for other irrelevant data
-Previous Season Tier just for more excuses
